 ## Description
  The program adds two N-bit binary numbers. When it's executed message is displayed to the user so the size will be selected. After, user inputs two binary numbers. Result is computed via the sequential algorithm and the Carry-Lookahead algorithm. Steps needed for each operation are also computed. For better understanding of the difference in efficiency of the two algorithms steps that Carry-Lookahead would need if the computer had N processors is also calculated.
